Tips on how to use ImageJ macro for quantification1) These macro requires plugin adaptiveThr. To download and install: https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/adaptivethreshold2) Set the correct path:Replace "/Users/lzhan/Desktop/Output/" to "/Your/Desired/Directory/"3) If using PC version of ImageJ, replace “/” to “\”4) Set the correct image names:After run("Split Channels");, the names of each channel could be different depending on the microscopy acquisition system used. Change the selectWindow code if needed. For examples, some image are named C1_image_name; C2_image_name; etc. Change selectWindow("C1_" + title);5) Because each batch of images are likely to have different exposure and resolution settings, optimal parameters such as brightness/contrast and pixel size needs to be set. Numbers in the following codes need to be adjusted for your specific images. Run a few images and check the quality control images in the output folder (e.g., ROI_IBA1_name).[change these parameters if necessary]setMinAndMax(0, 100);run("adaptiveThr ", "using=Mean from=100 then=-20");run("Analyze Particles...", "size=30-500 show=Masks exclude add")6) Running analysis in batch mode:On ImageJ/FIJI, select “Process” – “Batch” – “Macro”. Set the correct Input folder and Output folder. Add macro code: [Select from list]Copy/paste the optimized macro code in the window.Click “Process”
